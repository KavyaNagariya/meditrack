Create a clean, responsive landing page for MediTrack Pro — a hospital-focused digital contact tracing and MDR screening tool. The goal is to quickly communicate value, build trust, and drive demo signups, while keeping navigation simple and including Login and Sign Up.

### Brand and tone
- Professional, calm, and trustworthy; accessible to busy clinicians and administrators.
- Color palette: hospital blues and teals with plenty of whitespace; sparing use of red for alerts.
- Typography: a modern, legible sans-serif (e.g., Inter or Segoe UI); clear hierarchy.

### Header and navigation
- Sticky header with logo left; right-aligned navigation and prominent buttons.
- Include Login and Sign Up buttons; Sign Up is primary.
- Minimal nav to reduce friction: Home, About, Contact Us, Pricing, FAQ.

```json
{
  "nav": ["Home", "About", "Contact Us", "Pricing", "FAQ"],
  "buttons": {
    "primary": {"label": "Sign Up", "action": "/signup"},
    "secondary": {"label": "Login", "action": "/login"},
    "accent": {"label": "Request Demo", "action": "#demo"}
  }
}
```
